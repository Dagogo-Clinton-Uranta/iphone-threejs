# An Iphone Replica Website using GSAP and Three JS

This project was done to hone my skills using animation and 3D modelling libraries such as GSAP and Three JS

It involved the use of GSAP methods such as GSAP.From() , GSAP.To(), GSAP.scrollTrigger() and GSAP.Timeline()

PerspectiveCamera, Ligths and OrbitControls from 'react-three-drei'  were also used in this project to make the 3D model come to life!
